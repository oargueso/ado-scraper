In December 2016 [eldiario.es](http://eldiario.es) published [this story](http://www.eldiario.es/desigualdadblog/exito-programa-ADO-rostro-mujer_6_592900718.html), where I showed that Spanish Olympic female athletes within the state-sponsored ADO programme outperform their male colleagues: they have won 60% more medals in the Olympic Games, and in World and European Championships since 2003. 

Please note that the data were gathered in August, 2016, just after the Olympic Games in Rio. No updates have been carried out since then.
